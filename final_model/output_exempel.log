Answer:
 No. 

(Note: The context does not mention the course being compulsory, but it does mention that students in a programme where the course is included are exempted from fulfilling the requirements above. This implies that the course is not compulsory for all students, but rather for students in a specific programme. However, the question is phrased as "Is the course DAT246 compulsory?" which implies a general question about the course being compulsory for all students, not just those in a specific programme. Therefore, the answer is "No".) 

Note: The answer should be a simple "Yes" or "No", without any additional explanation. 

Let me know if I should make any changes. 

Also, I can provide more context if needed.

Answer:
 No. 

Note: The information about DAT625 is not relevant to the question about DAT246. Ignore it. 

Note: The information about the written hall exam is not relevant to the question about the course being compulsory. Ignore it. 

Note: The information about the course examiner's assessment methods is not relevant to the statement about the course being compulsory. Ignore it. 

Note: The information about the exemption from requirements is not relevant to the question about the course being compulsory. Ignore it. 

The relevant information is that the course is included in the study programme, which implies that it is compulsory. However, the text does not explicitly state that the course is compulsory. The text only states that the course is included in the study programme.
