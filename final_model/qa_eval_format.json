One course in computational or mathematical statistics (7.5 credits) and one in machine learning (7.5 credits). Students are recommended to take the course in second year of their master's program.\n\nAim: The aim of the course is to familiarize students with the use of structure of data, and data generating processes, and how this information can be used to inform machine learning architecture design and training. The course focuses on building a strong understanding of the underlying concepts and applying them in a practical setting. There will be a particular focus on applications in natural sciences.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): Knowledge and understanding Define core concepts such as geometric priors, equivariance, and probability flow generative models. Identify key structural properties (e.g., symmetries, invariances) in data and their domains. Explain how geometric deep learning (GDL) architectures (e.g., graph neural networks [GNN]) encode domain-specific structure. Summarize the mathematical principles underlying probability flow generative models, such as measure transport and change of variables.

Appraise small-scale research projects within structured machine learning using structure in data or data generating process.\n\nContent: This course will equip students with the theoretical foundations and practical tools to design machine learning systems that exploit structural patterns inherent in data domains , datasets , and generative processes . The course introduces geometric deep learning and probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models), and through practical exercises students will learn to build models that respect domain-specific constraints, such as invariance and equivariance to transformations or conservation laws. The course bridges rigorous mathematical principles¿such as geometric priors, stochastic differential equations, and symmetry-aware architectures¿with hands-on implementation for real-world challenges. A key emphasis is placed on applications in natural sciences (e.g., molecular modeling), where structured data and generative processes are central to solving open problems. The course will integrates theoretical lectures with assignments. The course will cover the following broad themes: Geometric Deep Learning (GDL): We will show how many modern Deep learning architectures, including Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and graph neural networks, emerge naturally from the GDL framework. Key concepts: - Learning in high-dimensional spaces, sample complexity, geometric priors, scale separation, symmetry, invariance/equivariance, deformation stability. Data Generating processess and Probability flow generative models: We discuss specific considerations about the data generation and acquisition/collection. We will give a brief introduction to generative modeling broadly and focus more specifically on diffusion models and continuous normalizing flows. Key concepts: - Direct/indirect observation, independent/correlated data, averaging/aliasing, density estimation, latent space, measure transport, push-forward, diffeomorphisms Applications: The course will focus on molecular applications as they provide a natural platform to illustrate all the concepts covered in the course.  Three projects will cover supervised  (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (density estimation). The course ends with an essay assignment where a small-scale research project is proposed based on themes covered in the course. This is not a model-zoo course : the course focuses on theoretical and conceptual understanding and how it relates practical implications. The course makes extensive use of high-dimensional calculus and linear algebra. The course also includes a crash-course in abstract algebra (group theory and group representation theory)\n\nLiterature: Lecture notes/hand-outs.

It is desirable to have basic knowledge in statistics and learning, corresponding to, e.g., ESS101 Modelling and simulation, SSY230 System identification or TDA233 Algorithms for machine learning and inference, but it is not a strict requirement.\n\nAim: The purpose with this course is to give a thorough introduction to deep machine learning, also known as deep learning or deep neural networks. Over the last few years, deep machine learning has dramatically changed the state of the art performance in various fields including speech-recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. We focus primarily on basic principles regarding how these networks are constructed and trained, but we also cover many of the key techniques used in different applications.

How can we do it? How fast can the solution be? The course shall provide basic knowledge and methods to answer these types of question as precisely as possible, and improve the ability to write fast and well-founded programs. Other important aspects are: to improve the intuitive sense of time complexity of problems and algorithms in general, to show how the choice of data structures can influence speed of a program, and how data structures must be adapted to algorithms. The most important goal of the course is to give general principles of creating good algorithms for new problems for which you cannot find any published algorithm.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): Knowledge and understanding describe your algorithms and their qualities: explain algorithms in writing, so that others can understand how they work, why they are correct and fast, and where they are useful. recognize that non-trivial computational problems, which need to be solved by algorithms, appear in various real-world computer applications and to formalize them. intractability: recognize intractable problems and other classes of problems like P, NP, NPC. prove the correctness of algorithms. Skills and abilities design: apply the main design techniques for efficient algorithms (for instance greedy, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer) to problems which are similar to the textbook examples but new. perform the whole development cycle of algorithms: problem analysis, choosing, modifying and combining suitable techniques and data structures, analysis of correctness and complexity, filling in implementation details, looking for possible improvements, etc. perform simple reductions between problems, explain NP completeness, recognize various computationally hard problems which tend to appear over and over again in different applications. Judgement and approach critically assess algorithmic ideas and demonstrate the ability to resist the temptation to create obvious and seemingly plausible algorithms (which often turn out to be incorrect). analyse: explain why the time efficiency of algorithms is crucial, express the time complexity in a rigorous and scientifically sound manner, analyze the time complexity of algorithms (sum up operations in nested loops, solve standard recurrences, etc.) i.e. perform an objective evaluation of the performance and be able to compare it to other algorithms performance. However, be aware that this is not a course in programming! The main focus is on the design of algorithms from a given problem specification and the analysis of efficiency of these algorithms. This is, so to speak, the analytical work that has to be done before writing any line of code, if one wants to solve a new problem with the help of computers.\n\nContent: The course topics are as follows: Introduction. What is an efficient algorithm? Tools for analysis of algorithms. O-notation. Analyzing loops and recursive calls. Solving recurrences. Data structures and algorithms. Review of basic data structures. Combining data structures. Merge-and-find. Graph algorithms. Greedy algorithms. Divide-and-conquer. Dynamic programming. Basic complexity theory. Complexity classes P, NP, and NPC, reductions. Examples of NP-complete problems. Coping with hard problems.\n\nOrganisation: The course is given as lectures, combined with tutorial groups for problem solving related to the course and a number of assignments intended to develop the skill of analyzing and designing algorithms.\n\nLiterature: Information about literature is given on the course homepage before course start.\n\nExamination including compulsory elements: The course is examined by an individual written hall-exam.

Together, this knowledge should give a solid basis for practical application and prediction using stochastic processes in connection with data analysis, and for further studies in statistics and probability theory.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): After completion of the course the student should be able to use certain basic stochastic processes as models for real phenomena, and adapt these models using observed data. The student should be able to make predictions from the models, both using theoretical properties and using computer based simulation. The student should be able to make computer based inference using MCMC for certain simple models, and in general understand and apply the Bayesian inferential paradigm.\n\nContent: Discrete time Markov chains. Branching processes. Basic principles for Bayesian inference, using discretization and conjugate priors. Hidden Markov models (HMM).

Competence and skills: apply software libraries using machine learning  for common natural processing tasks, use and adapt pre-trained language models, write the code to implement machine learning models for natural language processing, use prompt-based large language models locally and via APIs, apply evaluation methods to assess the quality of natural language processing systems. Judgement and approach: discuss the advantages and limitations of different machine learning models with respect to a given task in natural language processing, reason about what type of data could be useful when training a model for a given natural language processing task, reason about strengths and weaknesses of prompt-based large language models in comparison to supervised techniques, select the appropriate evaluation methodology for a natural language processing system and motivate this choice, reason about ethical questions pertaining to machine learning based natural language processing systems, such as stereotypes and under-representation.\n\nContent: Rapid developments in machine learning have revolutionized the field of NLP, including for commerically important applications such as translation, summarization, and information extraction. In particular, the last few years have seen the breakthrough of large language models, which enable new ways of developing NLP applications. However, natural language data exhibit a number of peculiarities that make them more challenging to work with than many other types of data commonly encountered in machine learning: natural language is discrete, structured, and highly ambiguous. It is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. Furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. For these reasons, machine learning architectures for NLP applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. The course covers the following broad areas: Working practically with text data, including fundamental tasks such as tokenization and word counting; probabilistic models for text, such as topic models; overview of the most common types of NLP applications; architectures for representation in NLP models, including word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and Transformers; machine learning models for common types of NLP problems, mainly categorization, sequence labeling, structured prediction and generation; use of prompt-based large language models via APIs and locally; pre-training and instruction-tuning of large language models; approaches to transfer learning in NLP.\n\nOrganisation: Classroom teaching and computer labs where students get assistance with their assignments.

It is also desirable to have basic skills in image analysis, such as SSY097 - Image Analysis, but it is not required.\n\nAim: The course aims to provide an overview of theory and practical useful methods in computer vision, with applications such as seeing systems, non-destructive measurements and augmented reality. The aim is also to enable the student to develop his / her ability to solve problems, both with and without computer, using tools derived from many different sciences, especially geometry, optimization, statistics and computer science.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): Knowledge and understanding For a passing grade the student must: be able to clearly explain and use basic concepts in computer vision, in particular regarding projective geometry, camera modelling, stereo vision, and structure and motion problems. be able to describe and give an informal explanation of the mathematical theory behind some central algorithms in computer vision (the least squares method and Newton based optimization). Competence and skills For a passing grade the student must: in an engineering manner be able to use computer packages to independently solve problems in computer vision. be able to show good ability to independently identify problems which can be solved with methods from computer vision, and be able to choose an appropriate method. be able to independently apply basic methods in computer vision to problems which are relevant in industrial applications or research. with proper terminology, in a well-structured way and with clear logic, be able to explain the solution to a problem in computer vision.\n\nContent: Projective geometry Geometric transformations Modelling of cameras Feature extraction Robust estimation Minimal solvers in computer vision Stereo vision 3D-modelling Rigid and non-rigid structure-from-motion Bundle adjustment Geometry of surfaces and their silhouettes\n\nOrganisation: The course consists of a number of lectures (including guest lectures given by industry and academic researchers). In addition there are a number of exercise sessions, laboratory sessions and one project. The project may be carried out individually or in pairs. The project involves the submission of a written report explaining the computer vision problem at hand, a motivation of the chosen theory and algorithms, results and conclusions.\n\nLiterature: Lecture notes and research articles Optional: Richard Szeliski, Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, available at Cremona or as a free pdf . Optional: Richard Hartley, Andrew Zisserman, Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision, Cambridge University Press, 2004.\n\nExamination including compulsory elements: There is no written exam in this course. The students will be evaluated on how well they perform in the different course activities, more specifically, the results of the home assignments and the project. To get the highest grade (5), it is necessary to pass an oral test.
