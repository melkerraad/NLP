How can we do it? How fast can the solution be? The course shall provide basic knowledge and methods to answer these types of question as precisely as possible, and improve the ability to write fast and well-founded programs. Other important aspects are: to improve the intuitive sense of time complexity of problems and algorithms in general, to show how the choice of data structures can influence speed of a program, and how data structures must be adapted to algorithms. The most important goal of the course is to give general principles of creating good algorithms for new problems for which you cannot find any published algorithm.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): Knowledge and understanding describe your algorithms and their qualities: explain algorithms in writing, so that others can understand how they work, why they are correct and fast, and where they are useful. recognize that non-trivial computational problems, which need to be solved by algorithms, appear in various real-world computer applications and to formalize them. intractability: recognize intractable problems and other classes of problems like P, NP, NPC. prove the correctness of algorithms. Skills and abilities design: apply the main design techniques for efficient algorithms (for instance greedy, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer) to problems which are similar to the textbook examples but new. perform the whole development cycle of algorithms: problem analysis, choosing, modifying and combining suitable techniques and data structures, analysis of correctness and complexity, filling in implementation details, looking for possible improvements, etc. perform simple reductions between problems, explain NP completeness, recognize various computationally hard problems which tend to appear over and over again in different applications. Judgement and approach critically assess algorithmic ideas and demonstrate the ability to resist the temptation to create obvious and seemingly plausible algorithms (which often turn out to be incorrect). analyse: explain why the time efficiency of algorithms is crucial, express the time complexity in a rigorous and scientifically sound manner, analyze the time complexity of algorithms (sum up operations in nested loops, solve standard recurrences, etc.) i.e. perform an objective evaluation of the performance and be able to compare it to other algorithms performance. However, be aware that this is not a course in programming! The main focus is on the design of algorithms from a given problem specification and the analysis of efficiency of these algorithms. This is, so to speak, the analytical work that has to be done before writing any line of code, if one wants to solve a new problem with the help of computers.\n\nContent: The course topics are as follows: Introduction. What is an efficient algorithm? Tools for analysis of algorithms. O-notation. Analyzing loops and recursive calls. Solving recurrences. Data structures and algorithms. Review of basic data structures. Combining data structures. Merge-and-find. Graph algorithms. Greedy algorithms. Divide-and-conquer. Dynamic programming. Basic complexity theory. Complexity classes P, NP, and NPC, reductions. Examples of NP-complete problems. Coping with hard problems.\n\nOrganisation: The course is given as lectures, combined with tutorial groups for problem solving related to the course and a number of assignments intended to develop the skill of analyzing and designing algorithms.\n\nLiterature: Information about literature is given on the course homepage before course start.\n\nExamination including compulsory elements: The course is examined by an individual written hall-exam.

In particular, it will give a probabilistic viewpoint of machine learning problems. Probability theory can be applied to any problem involving uncertainty. In machine learning, uncertainty comes in many forms, e.g., the noise in the collected data, or uncertainty about the best prediction given some past data or in what is the best suited model to explain the data. The key idea behind the probabilistic framework to machine learning is that learning can be thought of as inferring plausible (probabilistic) models to describe data that one could observe from a system. Probabilistic models are able to make predictions and statements about observable data and are also capable to express the uncertainty of the predictions. The course will describe a wide variety of probabilistic models, suitable for a wide variety of data and tasks. It will also describe a wide variety of algorithms for inference and learning, when using such models. The goal is to present a unified view of machine learning through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. In the course the students will also learn universal models/methods that are useful in probabilistic machine learning, but also in other areas.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): Explain the philosophy behind Bayesian inference Develop an inference algorithm using the principles of Bayesian decision theory and a given cost function Understand the connections between probability theory and machine learning Explain similarities and differences between probabilistic and classical machine learning methods Interpret and explain results from probabilistic machine learning Derive, analyze, and implement the probabilistic methods introduced in the course Understand how to apply several probabilistic models to data and determine the most suitable one for a given task Discuss and determine whether an engineering-relevant problem can be formulated as a supervised or unsupervised machine learning problem\n\nContent: Bayesian inference, probabilistic modeling of data Supervised learning: Bayesian linear regression Bayesian graphical models Monte Carlo techniques: importance sampling, Gibbs sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Markov random fields, factor graphs Belief propagation, variable elimination Hidden Markov models Expectation propagation and variational inference Gaussian processes Unsupervised learning Generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders: two methods for unsupervised learning, Probabilistic deep learning\n\nOrganisation: The course comprises lectures, weekly home assignments and tutorial sessions related to the home assignments.\n\nLiterature: We will mainly use Christopher M.

Competence and skills: apply software libraries using machine learning  for common natural processing tasks, use and adapt pre-trained language models, write the code to implement machine learning models for natural language processing, use prompt-based large language models locally and via APIs, apply evaluation methods to assess the quality of natural language processing systems. Judgement and approach: discuss the advantages and limitations of different machine learning models with respect to a given task in natural language processing, reason about what type of data could be useful when training a model for a given natural language processing task, reason about strengths and weaknesses of prompt-based large language models in comparison to supervised techniques, select the appropriate evaluation methodology for a natural language processing system and motivate this choice, reason about ethical questions pertaining to machine learning based natural language processing systems, such as stereotypes and under-representation.\n\nContent: Rapid developments in machine learning have revolutionized the field of NLP, including for commerically important applications such as translation, summarization, and information extraction. In particular, the last few years have seen the breakthrough of large language models, which enable new ways of developing NLP applications. However, natural language data exhibit a number of peculiarities that make them more challenging to work with than many other types of data commonly encountered in machine learning: natural language is discrete, structured, and highly ambiguous. It is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. Furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. For these reasons, machine learning architectures for NLP applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. The course covers the following broad areas: Working practically with text data, including fundamental tasks such as tokenization and word counting; probabilistic models for text, such as topic models; overview of the most common types of NLP applications; architectures for representation in NLP models, including word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and Transformers; machine learning models for common types of NLP problems, mainly categorization, sequence labeling, structured prediction and generation; use of prompt-based large language models via APIs and locally; pre-training and instruction-tuning of large language models; approaches to transfer learning in NLP.\n\nOrganisation: Classroom teaching and computer labs where students get assistance with their assignments. Classroom activities usually follow an interactive flipped classroom format, but there are also occasional lectures. No activities with compulsory attendance.\n\nLiterature: Course literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.\n\nExamination including compulsory elements: The course is examined by mandatory written assignments submitted as written reports, as well as a self-defined project that requires the submission of a written report and an oral presentation. Some of the assignments will be carried out individually and others in groups of normally 2-4 students. The project is conducted by 2-4 students. A late submission of the assignments or project results in the grade Fail (U), unless special reasons exist. A failed assignment or project will be given the opportunity to submit a new solution on subsequent occasions the course is given. A passing grade for the entire course requires at least a passing grade for all assignments and the project. To be awarded a higher passing grade for the entire course, the student must, in addition, have a higher average on the weighted grades on the assignments and the project. The course examiner may assess individual students in other ways than what is stated above if there are special reasons for doing so, for example if a student has a decision from Chalmers about disability study support.\n\nOverview: Swedish name Maskininlärning för språkteknologi Code DAT450 Credits 7.5 Credits Owner MPDSC Education cycle Second-cycle Main field of study Software Engineering Department COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING Grading TH - Pass with distinction (5), Pass with credit (4), Pass (3), Fail\n\nContact Chalmers: Phone +46-317721000 Mail address Chalmers University of Technology 412 96 Gothenburg E-mail and more contact information Organisation number 556479-5598\n\nEducation: Your studies Our Master's degree programmes Student support Services and tools Canvas learning management system Safe at Chalmers Chalmers student union\n\nShortcuts: Work at Chalmers Press and media Whistleblowing at Chalmers Safety and emergency situations Supplier information Chalmers University of Technology Foundation\n\nAbout the website: Cookies Processing of personal data Accessibility statement Service Disruptions at Chalmers\n\nContact Chalmers: Phone +46-317721000 Mail address Chalmers University of Technology 412 96 Gothenburg E-mail and more contact information Organisation number 556479-5598",

Knowledge equivalent to at least three of the following course's content: Linear algebra (7.5 credits), numerical mathematics or scientific computing (7.5 credits), calculus (7.5 credits), or statistical mechanics/thermodynamics (7.5 credits). One course in computational or mathematical statistics (7.5 credits) and one in machine learning (7.5 credits). Students are recommended to take the course in second year of their master's program.\n\nAim: The aim of the course is to familiarize students with the use of structure of data, and data generating processes, and how this information can be used to inform machine learning architecture design and training. The course focuses on building a strong understanding of the underlying concepts and applying them in a practical setting. There will be a particular focus on applications in natural sciences.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): Knowledge and understanding Define core concepts such as geometric priors, equivariance, and probability flow generative models. Identify key structural properties (e.g., symmetries, invariances) in data and their domains. Explain how geometric deep learning (GDL) architectures (e.g., graph neural networks [GNN]) encode domain-specific structure. Summarize the mathematical principles underlying probability flow generative models, such as measure transport and change of variables. Interpret the role of inductive biases (e.g., locality, symmetry) in model design for scientific applications. Skills and abilities Implement geometric deep learning architectures (e.g., GNNs) using frameworks like PyTorch Geometric. Implement and simulate probability flow generative models (e.g., diffusion models or continuous normalizing flows) subject to certain domain symmetries. Compare the trade-offs between equivariant architectures (e.g., invariant vs. equivariant layers) in terms of expressivity, computational cost, and sample complexity. Judgment and approach Judge recent scientific reports on machine learning research projects using structure in data or data generating process. Propose a small-scale research project that builds-on or applies upon themes covered in the course. Appraise small-scale research projects within structured machine learning using structure in data or data generating process.\n\nContent: This course will equip students with the theoretical foundations and practical tools to design machine learning systems that exploit structural patterns inherent in data domains , datasets , and generative processes . The course introduces geometric deep learning and probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models), and through practical exercises students will learn to build models that respect domain-specific constraints, such as invariance and equivariance to transformations or conservation laws. The course bridges rigorous mathematical principles¿such as geometric priors, stochastic differential equations, and symmetry-aware architectures¿with hands-on implementation for real-world challenges. A key emphasis is placed on applications in natural sciences (e.g., molecular modeling), where structured data and generative processes are central to solving open problems. The course will integrates theoretical lectures with assignments. The course will cover the following broad themes: Geometric Deep Learning (GDL): We will show how many modern Deep learning architectures, including Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and graph neural networks, emerge naturally from the GDL framework. Key concepts: - Learning in high-dimensional spaces, sample complexity, geometric priors, scale separation, symmetry, invariance/equivariance, deformation stability. Data Generating processess and Probability flow generative models: We discuss specific considerations about the data generation and acquisition/collection. We will give a brief introduction to generative modeling broadly and focus more specifically on diffusion models and continuous normalizing flows. Key concepts: - Direct/indirect observation, independent/correlated data, averaging/aliasing, density estimation, latent space, measure transport, push-forward, diffeomorphisms Applications: The course will focus on molecular applications as they provide a natural platform to illustrate all the concepts covered in the course.  Three projects will cover supervised  (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (density estimation). The course ends with an essay assignment where a small-scale research project is proposed based on themes covered in the course. This is not a model-zoo course : the course focuses on theoretical and conceptual understanding and how it relates practical implications. The course makes extensive use of high-dimensional calculus and linear algebra.

The course treats the basics principles for analyzing the properties of an optimisation problem, and the characterization of feasible points that are (locally) optimal. This theory is used to develop a number of examples of optimisation methods, that can be used to solve instances of practical optimisation problem. The course also aims to give some practical training in mathematical modelling and problem solving using optimisation.\n\nLearning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to): The goal is that you, after completing the course, should understand parts of the theory of optimality, duality, and convexity, and their interrelations. In this way, you will be able to analyze many types of optimization problems occurring in practice and both classify them and provide guidelines as to how they should be solved. The latter is the more practical goal of an otherwise mainly theoretical course. More precisely, after completing the course you should be able to: state and explain the most important concepts in convex analysis, convex optimization, and duality, and be able to apply the theory on concrete examples. state and explain the basics of necessary and sufficient optimality conditions, in particular the KKT conditions, and be able to utilize the theory to analyze and solve concrete examples. analyze linear programming problems using concepts such as duality and sensitivity; solve linear programming programs using the simplex method and explain how the method works. explain notions such as descent and feasible direction, and use these concepts to explain the principles behind, to analyze, and to apply classical optimization methods, e.g., steepest descent, variations of Newton's method, the Frank-Wolfe method, and penalty methods; be able to specify conditions under which these methods converge. formulate relevant parts of a real-world problem in terms of a mathematical optimization model, analyze the model using appropriate tools and methods, and apply appropriate solution algorithms.\n\nContent: This basic course in optimization describes the most relevant mathematical principles that are used to analyze and solve optimization problems in continuous variables. A rough separation and overview of the content is as follows. Convex analysis: convex set, polytope, polyhedron, cone, representation theorem, extreme point, Farkas Lemma, convex function Optimality conditions and duality: global/local optimum, existence and uniqueness of optimal solutions, variational inequality, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, complementarity conditions, Lagrange multiplier, Lagrangian dual problem, global optimality conditions, weak/strong duality Linear programming (LP): LP models, LP algebra and geometry, basic feasible solution (BFS), the Simplex method, LP duality, optimality conditions, strong duality, complementarity, interior point methods, sensitivity analysis Nonlinear optimization methods: direction of descent, line search, (quasi-)Newton methods, Frank--Wolfe method, gradient projection, exterior and interior penalty methods.\n\nOrganisation: Lectures, exercises, two computer exercises, and a project assignment that comprises mathematical modelling and the solution of a concrete optimization problem med industrial relevance.
