The latter is the more practical goal of an otherwise mainly theoretical course. More precisely, after completing the course you should be able to: state and explain the most important concepts in convex analysis, convex optimization, and duality, and be able to apply the theory on concrete examples. state and explain the basics of necessary and sufficient optimality conditions, in particular the KKT conditions, and be able to utilize the theory to analyze and solve concrete examples. analyze linear programming problems using concepts such as duality and sensitivity; solve linear programming programs using the simplex method and explain how the method works. explain notions such as descent and feasible direction, and use these concepts to explain the principles behind, to analyze, and to apply classical optimization methods, e.g., steepest descent, variations of Newton's method, the Frank-Wolfe method, and penalty methods; be able to specify conditions under which these methods converge. formulate relevant parts of a real-world problem in terms of a mathematical optimization model, analyze the model using appropriate tools and methods, and apply appropriate solution algorithms."

The course introduces geometric deep learning and probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models), and through practical exercises students will learn to build models that respect domain-specific constraints, such as invariance and equivariance to transformations or conservation laws. The course bridges rigorous mathematical principles¿such as geometric priors, stochastic differential equations, and symmetry-aware architectures¿with hands-on implementation for real-world challenges. A key emphasis is placed on applications in natural sciences (e.g., molecular modeling), where structured data and generative processes are central to solving open problems. The course will integrates theoretical lectures with assignments. The course will cover the following broad themes: Geometric Deep Learning (GDL): We will show how many modern Deep learning architectures, including Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and graph neural networks, emerge naturally from the GDL framework. Key concepts: - Learning in high-dimensional spaces, sample complexity, geometric priors, scale separation, symmetry, invariance/equivariance, deformation stability. Data Generating processess and Probability flow generative models: We discuss specific considerations about the data generation and acquisition/collection. We will give a brief introduction to generative modeling broadly and focus more specifically on diffusion models and continuous normalizing flows. Key concepts: - Direct/indirect observation, independent/correlated data, averaging/aliasing, density estimation, latent space, measure transport, push-forward, diffeomorphisms Applications: The course will focus on molecular applications as they provide a natural platform to illustrate all the concepts covered in the course.  Three projects will cover supervised  (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (density estimation). The course ends with an essay assignment where a small-scale research project is proposed based on themes covered in the course. This is not a model-zoo course : the course focuses on theoretical and conceptual understanding and how it relates practical implications. The course makes extensive use of high-dimensional calculus and linear algebra. The course also includes a crash-course in abstract algebra (group theory and group representation theory)"

Neural networks are distributed computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain, consisting of many simple processing elements that are connected in a network. Neural networks have revolutionised how we solve important problems in the engineering sciences, such as image analysis (object recognition and location), prediction, and control. The course gives an overview and a basic understanding of currently used neural-network algorithms, and exhibits similarities as well as differences between these methods. The main emphasis of this introductory course is on three connected topics: recurrent (Hopfield) networks, supervised learning with deep neural networks, and unsupervised learning (reinforcement learning). The goal is to explain how and why the algorithms work, when and how they fail, how to program the standard methods from scratch, and how to use packages that allow to easily set up and to efficiently run larger networks."

These techniques can be used to subjectively improve image  quality for the end-user (image enhancement), remove known image distortions (image restoration) and to reduce image data sizes for storage or transmission (image compression). These techniques are valuable in a range of applications and careers including, but not limited to, medical imaging, astronomy, remote sensing, automation etc. Stress is placed on deep understanding of the principles underlying the techniques rather than memory learning of algorithms."

Other important aspects are: to improve the intuitive sense of time complexity of problems and algorithms in general, to show how the choice of data structures can influence speed of a program, and how data structures must be adapted to algorithms. The most important goal of the course is to give general principles of creating good algorithms for new problems for which you cannot find any published algorithm."

Skills and abilities design: apply the main design techniques for efficient algorithms (for instance greedy, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer) to problems which are similar to the textbook examples but new. perform the whole development cycle of algorithms: problem analysis, choosing, modifying and combining suitable techniques and data structures, analysis of correctness and complexity, filling in implementation details, looking for possible improvements, etc. perform simple reductions between problems, explain NP completeness, recognize various computationally hard problems which tend to appear over and over again in different applications. Judgement and approach critically assess algorithmic ideas and demonstrate the ability to resist the temptation to create obvious and seemingly plausible algorithms (which often turn out to be incorrect). analyse: explain why the time efficiency of algorithms is crucial, express the time complexity in a rigorous and scientifically sound manner, analyze the time complexity of algorithms (sum up operations in nested loops, solve standard recurrences, etc.) i.e. perform an objective evaluation of the performance and be able to compare it to other algorithms performance. However, be aware that this is not a course in programming! The main focus is on the design of algorithms from a given problem specification and the analysis of efficiency of these algorithms. This is, so to speak, the analytical work that has to be done before writing any line of code, if one wants to solve a new problem with the help of computers."

In particular, the last few years have seen the breakthrough of large language models, which enable new ways of developing NLP applications. However, natural language data exhibit a number of peculiarities that make them more challenging to work with than many other types of data commonly encountered in machine learning: natural language is discrete, structured, and highly ambiguous. It is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. Furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. For these reasons, machine learning architectures for NLP applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. The course covers the following broad areas: Working practically with text data, including fundamental tasks such as tokenization and word counting; probabilistic models for text, such as topic models; overview of the most common types of NLP applications; architectures for representation in NLP models, including word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and Transformers; machine learning models for common types of NLP problems, mainly categorization, sequence labeling, structured prediction and generation; use of prompt-based large language models via APIs and locally; pre-training and instruction-tuning of large language models; approaches to transfer learning in NLP."

In particular, it will give a probabilistic viewpoint of machine learning problems. Probability theory can be applied to any problem involving uncertainty. In machine learning, uncertainty comes in many forms, e.g., the noise in the collected data, or uncertainty about the best prediction given some past data or in what is the best suited model to explain the data. The key idea behind the probabilistic framework to machine learning is that learning can be thought of as inferring plausible (probabilistic) models to describe data that one could observe from a system. Probabilistic models are able to make predictions and statements about observable data and are also capable to express the uncertainty of the predictions. The course will describe a wide variety of probabilistic models, suitable for a wide variety of data and tasks. It will also describe a wide variety of algorithms for inference and learning, when using such models. The goal is to present a unified view of machine learning through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. In the course the students will also learn universal models/methods that are useful in probabilistic machine learning, but also in other areas."

Computing scientists need to be able to understand problems that originate in areas that may be unfamiliar to them, and to identify computational methods and approaches that can be used to solve them. Biological concepts needed to understand the problems will be introduced. This is an advanced level course which uses research articles as the main reference materials. Reading research articles is valuable training for scientists and researchers. These demonstrate how to present ideas and methods, and how to critically evaluate them. Developing skill in reading research articles is useful preparation for future scientific investigations, and one's own scientific writing can improve through reading."

Besides providing theoretical understanding of how to analyze and think about such questions, a major ambition of this course is to expose students to useful tools and tactics that will help transform an idea or technology into a validated business model."

Inference is to compute the desired answers or actions based on the model. Algorithms of this kind are commonly used in for example classification tasks (character recognition, or to predict if a new customer is creditworthy, etc.) and in expert systems (for example for medical diagnosis). A new and commercially important area of application is data mining, where the algorithms are used to automatically detect interesting information and relations in large commercial or scientific databases.

These include NoSQL systems, including graph databases, and systems based on Semantic Web standards. This course provides an overview of todays database management system landscape and highlights major trends. The course also includes concepts related to the implementation of database management systems since it is necessary to understand these concepts in order to appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of different database management systems.

        "content": "Initiation The thesis is to be written by a single student or two students working together. The student contacts an examiner or the master program responsible can suggest an examiner. The student formulates a brief written description of the topic for the thesis. The description should contain the background, purpose, objective and possibly the method. The examiner will ensure that the student and the project meet the requirements for general and specific prerequisites and the general intended learning outcomes for theses. The master program responsible ensures that the thesis falls within the main subject of the Master's programme. If the student is accepted in a five years program for Master of Science in Engineering or Architecture, the master program responsible should as well assess and approve that the master thesis is relevant for the appropriate technical/architectural subject area. The student submits information of the thesis project via the web form at Chalmer's education pages, Your studies. The examiner and the master program responsible sign their approval before registration in Ladok is done. Planning The student must write a planning report providing a detailed description of the problem/task. The planning report must contain the background, purpose, objective, scope, method and timetable for completion of the thesis. The planning report is submitted to the examiner for approval. Supervision The students are entitled to guidance during the course of their work. Interim reporting After twenty working weeks on a 60 hec thesis, the student must report the status of the work to the examiner and the master program responsible. An approved interim report results in 30 hec being registered in Ladok. Written report The thesis must be written in English. The cover, etc., of the thesis must be formulated according to the instruction and templates at \"Design and Publish master Thesis\" at Chalmers. See Chalmers Education pages, Your studies. The thesis must be parsed using anti-plagiarism software. Chalmers' policies regarding open access and confidentiality apply to the work on the thesis and to publishing the report and the master thesis in whole should be open access. The thesis must be published electronically in Chalmers Open Digital Repository (ODR) Student theses according to the applicable rules for electronic publication of theses at Chalmers. When two students work jointly on a thesis, the division of the work must be clearly stated in the thesis. Oral presentation The oral presentation begins with the student describing the work. This is followed by a defense of the findings, and a discussion. The oral presentation must be made in English. This presentation may not take more than 60 minutes, of which approximately 1/3 of the time should be devoted to a defense of the thesis and discussion. At the time of the oral presentation, the written thesis must be completed but not published. This is to make it possible to include viewpoints that arise during the oral presentation to be incorporated into the thesis. The oral presentation, including a defense of the thesis, must be done at Chalmers at an open seminar. Any additional presentations can be made at a company or other external organisations, if necessary. In exceptional cases, for example, if thesis research has been conducted abroad, the examiner may grant a dispensation from the requirement for an oral presentation, defense of the findings in the thesis and presence at other presentations at Chalmers. The presentation of the thesis must be announced at the department at least two weeks prior to the date of the presentation. The presentation must be held in the period between August 15 and June 15, during normal office hours. Additional information on the execution of the master thesis work can be available at the department."

Interim reporting After twenty working weeks on a 60 hec thesis, the student must report the status of the work to the examiner and the master program responsible. An approved interim report results in 30 hec being registered in Ladok. Written report The thesis must be written in English. The cover, etc., of the thesis must be formulated according to the instruction and templates at \"Design and Publish master Thesis\" at Chalmers. See Chalmers Education pages, Your studies. The thesis must be parsed using anti-plagiarism software. Chalmers' policies regarding open access and confidentiality apply to the work on the thesis and to publishing the report and the master thesis in whole should be open access. The thesis must be published electronically in Chalmers Open Digital Repository (ODR) Student theses according to the applicable rules for electronic publication of theses at Chalmers. When two students work jointly on a thesis, the division of the work must be clearly stated in the thesis. Oral presentation The oral presentation begins with the student describing the work. This is followed by a defense of the findings, and a discussion. The oral presentation must be made in English. This presentation may not take more than 60 minutes, of which approximately 1/3 of the time should be devoted to a defense of the thesis and discussion. At the time of the oral presentation, the written thesis must be completed but not published. This is to make it possible to include viewpoints that arise during the oral presentation to be incorporated into the thesis. The oral presentation, including a defense of the thesis, must be done at Chalmers at an open seminar. Any additional presentations can be made at a company or other external organisations, if necessary. In exceptional cases, for example, if thesis research has been conducted abroad, the examiner may grant a dispensation from the requirement for an oral presentation, defense of the findings in the thesis and presence at other presentations at Chalmers. The presentation of the thesis must be announced at the department at least two weeks prior to the date of the presentation. The presentation must be held in the period between August 15 and June 15, during normal office hours. Additional information on the execution of the master thesis work can be available at the department."
